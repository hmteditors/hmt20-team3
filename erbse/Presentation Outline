1. Our discovery in 260v, main scholion 2
  - Briefly introduce what the scholion/issue is about
  - Aristophanes in the 10th century
  - Ptolemy of Ascalon
  - Implications:
    - an issue that has reoccurred over centuries
    - Main scholia tradition: treat as one word
    - the scribe expects us to have read and remembered his commentary from Book 2
    - first person voice? we/I?
  - Steps: looking for the same person's commentary on prosody in Book 2

2. What we found in Book 2:
  - hyphen!!! (according to the scribe: official main text tradition: one word)
  - 2 interlinears from the scribe on word meaning and grammar
  - 1 interlinear from the reader
  - main scholion: another dispute
    - οὐ γὰρ (ὥσ τινές): previous disputes
    - translate and introduce scholion
    - discovery: repetition, an earlier, rougher explanation
    - who is talking here? same person?
    - where is the prosody?
  - Steps:
    - look around on the folio
    - search in Erbse for key words: ὑπέρμορον/α, citation words, adverb, noun, ...
    and looked up the folio where the words occurred
    - result: hypothesis: the commentary did not make it to Venetus A

3. Looking Further/Biggest Question:
  - separate or together, it does not affect
    - the meaning
    - the meter

4. Conclusion
  - the importance of Homer down to a very detailed/specific level
  - the exactness of Greek grammar




To-do List:
1. try a search on all ὑπέρμορον/α ὑπέρ μορον/α (how to filter out the accent?) and see how it is written
2.
